    <h1>Installing Windows anywhere - is this real and how to do it?</h1><br>
    <h2>Is this real?</h2>
    Yup! I made a RedibleSky 10 setup using this method.<br>
    <h2>How to do it?</h2>
    After setup reboots, boot back to it. Then press Shift + F10 and type this line by line into the command prompt:<br>
    <code><br>
      C:<br>
      ren "C:\Windows" "C:\[the name for the windows folder]"
      diskpart<br>
      sel dis 0<br>
      lis par<br>
      sel par X (where X is the partition marked as System)<br>
      ass letter w<br>
      exit<br>
      bcdboot C:\[windows folder] /s W:<br>
      bcdedit<br>
      bcdedit /set [identifier for windows boot loader] systemroot \[windows folder name]<br>
      bcdedit /set [identifier from before] path \[windows folder]\system32\winload.efi<br>
      regedit<br>
    </code>
    <br>Now in the registry editor import two hives from "C:\[windows folder]\system32\config": SYSTEM and SOFTWARE, call SYSTEM as sys and SOFTWARE as soft.<br>
    Then export both into the root of C: and exit the registry editor. In CMD type "notepad C:\sys.reg" and then replace ALL occurences of "C:\\Windows" with "C:\\[name]" (warning: the double slashes are important! do NOT replace them with single slashes!]<br>
    Do then the same with C:\soft.reg. Save changes after finished, then type "C:\sys.reg && C:\soft.reg" then accept the warning and you should be done with the PE. Type "wpeutil reboot" and press enter.
    <h2>I got an installation etror, is this a scam?</h2><br>
    No, of course not! Press Shift + F10, enter "net user /add [username] [optional password]", then if you got an error "the user got created but was not added to the USERS localgroup.", enter "net localgroup users /add [name]", then "net localgroup administrators /add [name]" (optionally but makes your life easier). Then enter Regedit, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup, set these values to zero: "SetupInProgress", "SystemSetupInProgress", "OOBEInProgress", and set "CmdLine" to nothing. Then enter "mmsys.cpl", look for the Network ID button, and select "home computer". Then either enter "shutdown /r /t 0", or "taskmgr", go to details and kill winlogon.exe. After this, the setup should have completed.
